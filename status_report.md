STATUS REPORT 1:

(1) What was accomplished during the week?

This week we figured out how to use the Spotify API, embed the Spotify player onto the web page, how to get recommendations using the Spotify API, accepting user input, and trying to make the weather API look better on the page.

(2) What were the challenges and issues the team faced during the week?

We were having a lot of problems trying to embed and SDK player on the page so the user could listen to a whole songs. We spent a lot of time trying to find alternatives like using the SoundCloud API, or trying to work around this through Spotify but we eventually settled on 30 second clips of recommended songs since it's hard to listen to whole songs because of copyright, and SoundCloud does not have to as large of a variety to make recommendations as Spotify does.

(3) What are your goals for the next week?

Do the CSS for the web page. Create a server and connect it to a database. Link user input to getting recommendations.
